# Kraken Origami
A Discord bot written using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) and [Krakenex](https://github.com/veox/python3-krakenex) to give data on crypto, in Discord.

Note: as of current, the SMA calculations are incorrect. They appear to be higher than the SMA values provided by [Kraken](trade.kraken.com).
